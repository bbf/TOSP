TOSP - Terraria Open Source Plugins

I'll be adding more documentation soon.

Download link: https://github.com/downloads/bbf/TOSP/TOSPlugins-latest.zip

To install, copy to your tMod plugins directory.

You need the Permissions plugin as well.

The following permissions are available:

* regionprotect.use
This permission allows users to create their own personal regions.

regionprotect.bigregions:
This permission allows users to make unlimited size regions.

regionprotect.admin:
This permission allows users to make changes even on protected regions.
