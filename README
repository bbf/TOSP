TOSP - Terraria Open Source Plugins


TOSP now includes it's own code injector.
Unlike tMod which distributes a modified exe (which is illegal BTW), TOSP does this injection at runtime.

Currently, the injector is just a proof of concept, and it need more more work before it's usefull at all.
I just want to receive some feedback from the Terraria staff if they would accept this method distribution.
As it includes no code from Terraria, it might be considered legal, and if it's ok with them, I'll continue it's development.
The current injector will just protect the server from any kind of tile modification.

To download the original Region Protect plugin (which uses tMod 0.10), use this link:

To install, copy to your tMod plugins directory.

You need the Permissions plugin as well.

The following permissions are available:

* regionprotect.use
This permission allows users to create their own personal regions.

regionprotect.bigregions:
This permission allows users to make unlimited size regions.

regionprotect.admin:
This permission allows users to make changes even on protected regions.
